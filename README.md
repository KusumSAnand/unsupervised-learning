## Overview

The project demonstrates the application of unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. The project uses two datasets from Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics: one with demographic information about the people of Germany, and one with that same information for customers of a mail-order sales company. We shall look at relationships between demographics features, organize the population into clusters, and see how prevalent customers are in each of the segments obtained.

Structure of the machine learning project :

   1. Data Preprocessing
   2. Feature Transformation
        * Feature Scaling
        * Perform Dimensionality Reduction
        * Interpret Principal Components
   3. Apply Clustering: general population and customer data
   4. Findings
   5. Conclusion
    
    
Note - Since were are working with proprietary data, the data files will not be made available.
